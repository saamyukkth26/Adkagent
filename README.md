# Vertex AI Agent Deployment Project

This project allows you to build and deploy a custom conversational agent to Google Cloud's **Vertex AI Agent Builder (Reasoning Engine)** using Python and Poetry. It supports remote deployment, session creation, and interaction with the agent via CLI.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Build & package a custom agent using Vertex AI
- Deploy it remotely to Google Cloud
- Create interactive sessions
- Send and receive messages via CLI
- Manage dependencies and deployment scripts using Poetry

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- Google Cloud project with Vertex AI enabled
- Authenticated with `gcloud auth application-default login`

---

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd GCP_Agent
````

### 2. Set up Poetry Environment

```bash
poetry install
poetry shell
```

### 3. Authenticate with Google Cloud

Ensure you're authenticated with your GCP project:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

---

## ☁️ Deploying to Google Cloud

### 1. Deploy Agent to Vertex AI

```bash
poetry run deploy-remote --create
```

This will:

* Package your agent
* Upload code to your GCS bucket
* Create a Reasoning Engine on Vertex AI

**Note:** This prints a `resource_id` like `1766053168719805616` — save it.

---

## 💬 Interacting with the Agent

### 2. Create a Session

```bash
poetry run deploy-remote --create_session --resource_id <your_resource_id>
```

Returns a `session_id`.

### 3. Send a Message

```bash
poetry run deploy-remote --send \
  --resource_id <your_resource_id> \
  --user_id test_user \
  --session_id <your_session_id> \
  --message "Hello, how are you?"
```

You will receive a response from the deployed agent.

---

## 📌 Example Workflow

```bash
# Start virtual environment
poetry shell

# Deploy agent
poetry run deploy-remote --create

# Create session
poetry run deploy-remote --create_session --resource_id 1766053168019855616

# Send message
poetry run deploy-remote --send --resource_id 1766053168719850616 --user_id test_user --session_id 2047779383837408432 --message "Tell me a joke."
```

---

## 🧩 Project Components

* **agent/agent.py**: Your Vertex AI agent logic (responds to messages).
* **deployment/remote.py**: Script that handles deploying, creating sessions, sending messages.
* **extra\_packages/**: Any additional modules to be included with the agent during deployment.
* **pyproject.toml**: Poetry config listing dependencies like `google-cloud-aiplatform`, `cloudpickle`, `pydantic`.

---

## 🧪 Testing Locally

If you want to test your agent without deploying, you can temporarily create a local script to import and call your agent class directly.

---

## 🗑️ Deleting the Agent (Optional)

You can implement a `--delete` option in your `remote.py` to clean up the Reasoning Engine if needed.
